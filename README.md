# Predicting Student Academic Success and Dropout using Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost and Voting Ensemble

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset used in it. The notebook presents a comprehensive study that investigates the implementation of diverse machine learning algorithms to predict student outcomes, with a particular emphasis on dropout and graduation scenarios. The study evaluates the efficacy of prominent algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and Voting Classifier, in effectively addressing the classification task. 

Analysing the obtained results, the notebook offers valuable insights into strategies aimed at mitigating student dropout challenges and improving overall academic outcomes. 

# Files

1. student_prediction.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file that provides the code, analysis, and explanation. <br>
2. data.csv: This is the dataset file used in the notebook. It contains 4424 records and 37 attributes. There is no missing value. Most features are categorical but are integer encode. The dataset for this notebook is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success

# Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and work with the dataset, you will need the following:

Python 3.x.xx <br>
Jupyter Notebook or any other notebook of your choice.<br>
Libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, imblearn and datetime)

# Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
git clone https://github.com/casieavisec/7072

2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the 'Requirements' section.
Using jupyter cell, do the following for library installation (if you have not installed already):<br>
go to a new cell and type,<br>
!pip install [library_name]<br>
run the cell.<br>
Example.<br>
!pip install xgboost

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
jupyter notebook <br>
Go to the folder where you saved the files. <br>
(Make sure files student_prediction.ipynb, and data.csv are in the same folder.) <br>
Open the student_prediction.ipynb notebook.

4. Follow the instructions and explanations in the notebook to explore the code, perform analysis, and understand the dataset.
